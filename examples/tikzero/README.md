# Examples
The examples in this directory are specific to training Ti*k*Zero adapters. Each
script has a command line interface and information about available options can
be found by invoking them with the `--help` flag.

> [!TIP]
> The [`eval.py`](../eval.py) evaluation script in the parent directory also
> works with adapters.
